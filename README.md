<h1>nixos-config</h1>

The NixOS config that I use. 

## Installation

I don't recommend rebuilding using my exact configuration due to the fact that it's very specific to me, but in case you wanted to here are the steps.

1. Clone the repository
2. Run ```cd nixos-config```
4. Install into `/etc/nixos` using `sudo ./install.sh`
5. [Rebuild your NixOS using the desired flake](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/flakes#Using_nix_flakes_with_NixOS)
